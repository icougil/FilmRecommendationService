# FilmRecommendationService kata

We have just started working in a startup that sells and rents out films over the Internet

Our product managers have told us that they want to add new functionalities by building a service that allows them to recommend films to the users of the current platform.

Requirements:
- Build a service that returns a list of films that are associated with a particular genre
- By default, the result must be ordered according to the average rating given to the films by the users
- A film should contain at least an id, a title, a year when it was published, one or more tags and one or more genres

Demo/solution:
- You can check the "_a solution_" branch to see the code I showed in my demo
